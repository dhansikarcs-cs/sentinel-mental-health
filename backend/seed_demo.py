Deletes ALL existing users and data, then creates exactly two accounts:
  - cel  (psychologist) / 1234
  - alaya (patient)     / 4321
Plus rich demo data (journals, moods, ring, bookings, followups,
clinical notes, notifications, psych journal, risk assessments).

Journal summaries are dual-mode:
  - patient summary  -> warm, motivating, validating
  - clinical summary -> clinical, third-person, structured
